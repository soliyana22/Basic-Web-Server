Project Title: Simple Node.js Web Server

Description:

This is a basic Node.js web server created using the Express.js framework. It serves a simple "Hello, World!" message at the root endpoint (/).

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
Installation:

Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git   

Use code with caution.

Replace your-username and your-repository-name with the actual GitHub repository URL.   

Navigate to the Project Directory:

Bash
cd your-repository-name
Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.

Running the Server:

Start the Server:

Bash
node index.js
Use code with caution.

Access the Server:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

Code Structure:   

The index.js file contains the core logic of the server:

JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening   
 on port ${port}`);
});
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

Import Express: Imports the Express.js framework.
Create an Express App: Creates an instance of the Express application.
Define a Route: Defines a route for the root path (/). When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the server sends the "Hello, World!" message.
Start the Server: Starts the server on the specified port (3000 in this case).
Customization:

Port Number: You can change the port number by modifying the port variable.
Response Message: Modify the message sent in the res.send() method.
Additional Routes: Define more routes to handle different requests and serve different content.
Deployment:

You can deploy this server to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform to make it accessible to the public. Follow the specific instructions provided by your chosen platform.
